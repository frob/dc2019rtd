      - demo| Scarry, start with the demo. Priciple, show the cool thing first.
        - Drupal backed chat
        - Phoenix backed Drupal Real-time comments
      - How does <insert thing> work?
        - Phoenix feature walkthrough
          - Channels | websockets
            - The connection from client to server
          - HTTP/2 | push only, browsers don't support stateful connections
            - templates support pushing assets
          - generator | mix plugins
            - helps you understand what to do and where to put things
          - live reloading
          - built in test
            - this means that it is built with the idea that there will be tests and test drivin development
          - web segregation

      - technology| High level
        - BEAM walkthrough
          - Erlang
            - 30 year old from Ericson
            - Erlang is good for communication at massive scale
              - Turns out that telephone switches are analagous to the web
              - https://youtu.be/bk3icU8iIto?t=779
            - Code can be deployed to a running server (code deltas)
              - The phones cannot be brought down for any reason
          - Processes and messages
            - the vm works like an operating system
            - automatically distributes processes across cpu and cores
            - process is cheap (around 1k) and has own garbage collection
            - one process doesn't block another
            - If a process dies, that is okay it's isolated, you can bring it back,
              - Have you tried turning it off and on again
              - https://youtu.be/bk3icU8iIto?t=939
          - concurancy
            - async isn't concurancy
            - WhatsApp 2 million on one node less than 20 people
            - Bleacher Report
              - from few minutes for a push
              - 150 aws instances with lots of caching
              - after 10-30ms response for push
              - 30 aws instances with no caching
            - RiotGames
          - Performance
            - WhatsApp 2 mill was Erlang
            - Bleacher Report was Pure Elixir
            - Phoenix 2 mill on a heafty server 40 cores 128GB ram
              - As benchmarked with 40 machines opening connectsions at 40/s to send wikipedia articles to eachother

      - architechture| How can we use this?
        - Easiest - Drupal as Drupal and Phoenix as Phoenix, include phoenix.js
          - Drupal, PHP, Maria, Nginx/Apache for HTTP/S
          - Phoenix, Postgres, Cowboy for WS
        - Easy - Drupal as Drupal, Phoenix as webserver/ESI
          - Drupal, PHP, Maria, Nginx/Apache for content management
          - Phoenix, Cowboy for application serving HTTP/S and WS
        - Hard - Drupal as CGI, Phoenix as webserver/ESI
          - Drupal, PHP, Maria for content management com via FastCGI
          - Phoenix, Cowboy for app serving

          - 03:50 Data Types
            - is_int
              - no maximum size
            - is_float
            - is_atom
              - ``` Atom \#{is_atom(:Drupal)}```
              - ``` Atom \#{is_atom(:"Drupal dot Org")}```
            - ranges
              ``` one_to_ten 1..10```
          - 06:38 Strings
            - double quotes ``` string = "Hello World!"```
            - String Length ``` String.length("Hello World!") ``` => 12
            - String concatination ``` "Hello" <> " " <> "World!"" ```
            - String search ``` String.contains?("foobar", "foo") ``` => true
            - String first char ``` String.first("foobar") ``` => "f"
            - String char at index ``` String.at("foobar", 3) ``` => "b"
            - String substring ``` String.slice("foobar", 3, 5) ``` => "bar"

            - String explode ``` String.capitalize("foobar", "b") ``` => ["foo", "oo"]
          - 12:44 Math
            - + - * /
            - integer division
              - ```div(5, 4)``` => 1
              - ```rem(5, 4)``` => 1
          - 13:30 Comparison
            - Data is typed
              - int vs float
                - ``` 7 == 7.0``` => true
                - ``` 7 === 7.0``` => false
            - and the rest
              - "> < <= >="
              - and or NOT && ||
          - 16:06 Decision Making
            - if age >= 18 do \
                "can vote" \
              else
                "cannot vote"
              end
            - unless age === 18 do
                "You are 18"
              else
              end
            - switch like statements
              - case some_variable do
                  1 -> "something"
                  2 -> "something else"
                  3 -> "something completely different"
                end
              - cond do
                  age >= 18 -> "can vote"
                  age >= 16 -> "can drive"
                  age >= 14 -> "cannot drive"
                  true -> "default"
                end
            - Ternatry
              - Just an if/else on one line
          - 23:15 Tuples
            - 2 to 4 values
            - not for enumerating, cannot use as a list
            - ``` is_tuple({1, 3.14, :Drupal}) ``` => true
            - append ```new_tuple = Tuple.append(old_tuple, 66) ```
            - get element ```el = elem(some_tuple, 2) ```
            - delete element ```new_tuple = Tuple.delete_at(old_tuple, 2) ```
            - insert element ```new_tuple = Tuple.insert_at(old_tuple, 2, "foobar") ```
            - get size ```new_tuple = tuple_size(old_tuple) ``` => 3
            - bunch of elements ``` eleven_nines = Tuple.duplicate(9, 11)```
            - ``` {name, quest, color} = {"Robin", "To find the holy grail", "red, no blue"}```
            - ``` IO.puts("favorite \#{color}")``` => "red, no blue"
          - 28:16 Lists
            - ```[1,2,3]```
            - list concatination ```[1,2,3] ++ [4,5,6]```
            - list subtraction ```list3 = list1 -- list2```
            - search
              - if 4 in list3 do end
            - first and everything lese
              - ```[head | tail] = list1``` => 1, [2, 3]
            - Enumerate through list
              - ``` Enum.each ["words", "in", "list"], fn word ->
                      IO.puts word
                    end
                ```
            - List.insert_at
            - List.delete_at
            - List.first
            - List.last
            - A list can also be a key value pair with tuples.
              - ``` list = [{name:} "Robin", {quest:} "To find the holy grail"] ```
              - remove the curly braces
          - 36:40 Maps
            - Like dictionaries
              - ``` map = %{"key" => "value", "key2" => "value2"}```
          - 39:33 Pattern Matching
          - 41:01 Anonymous Functions
            - normal syntax, should be familiar
              - ```add_things = fn (a, b) -> a + b end```
            - short syntax
              - ```add_things = &(&1 + &2)```
            - one function many definitions
              - ``` add_things = fn
                      {a, b} -> a + b
                      {a, b, c} -> a + b + c
                    end```
              - ```add_things.({1, 2})
          - 45:52 Recursion
            - ``` def print_list([element|list]) do
                    IO.puts element
                    print_list(list)
                  end
                    def print_list([]), {do:} nil
                    remove the curly brackets
              ```
          - 48:48 Looping
            - There is no looping, You will need to use recursion or Enumerables
          - 53:05 Enumerables
            - Enum.each
            - Enum.map
            - Enum.reduce([], fn)
            - Enum.uniq([])
          - 58:19 List Comprehensions
            - ```even_list = for n <- [1,2,3,4,5,6], rem(n,2) == 0, {do:} n```
            - remeber that the last statement is always returned from a function
          - 59:53 Exception Handling
          - 1:01:21 Concurrency
            - spawn(fn() -> do_stuff("foobar") end)
            - send(self(), {:greeting, "Robin"})
            - recieve do
                {:greeting, name} -> IO.puts "Hello \#{name}"
                {:farewell, name} -> IO.puts "Goodbye \#{name}"
              after
                500 -> IO.puts "I didn't want to talk to you anyway!"
              end
        - mix https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html
          - This is the built in build tool for elixir, liken to npm or composer
          - But with other generators built in
            - Think Drupal console and composer mixed together and fully supported as native parts of the language
        - rebar
          - Kind of like mix, but for Erlang.
          - Technically Rebar3
        - unit tests
          - ExUnit - built in unit test framework
        - Hex Packages
        - documentation
          - https://hexdocs.pm/
          - Hexdocs is a place for hex packages to host their documentation
        - pattern matching
          - How many people here are familiar with Drupal 7 and hook based development?
            - remember how we would do this?
              - ``` function example_login_form_form_alter($form, $form_state) ```
            - Pattern matching makes this a part of the language in an interesting way.
              - https://youtu.be/gom6nEvtl3U?t=1159
              - you don't need to use switch or if as much for branching
            - So (hook alter example) becomes
              - ``` def hook_alter(form_id = 'login_form', form, _form_state) ```
        - pipes
          - https://youtu.be/gom6nEvtl3U?t=1308
          - wraps the paramaters to wrapping functions
          - so ```$array = reset(array_keys($old_array)) ```
            - would become ```$old_array |> array_keys, reset ```
        - ubmbrella
          - An umbrella app is an app that surrounds other apps
        - module
          - no classes only module namespaces
        - function
          - pattern matching
          - underscores are ignored by compiler
          - default values with double backslash \\
            - ``` def somefunc(foo \\ "bar") do
                    IO.puts foo
                  end```
        - arity
        - Mod.fun/arity
        - OTP
          - Open Telecom Platform
          - gives us supervision trees, event managers, and other goodness.
          - Basically all of the Erlang Platform.
        - GenServer
          - PID
          - cast
          - each process has a mailbox
          - think of it like microservives
          - Let it die
            - don't worry about error handling
            - BEAM cannot segfault
        - Supervisors
          - reboots the worker processes
          - processes started by supervisores aren't called by pid, but insteadh machinname
          - Agents can be used to save state
        - Phoenix
          - Framework build on Elixir
          - app vs app_web | seperate the frontend code from the web frontent
          - context | Dedicated modules that expose related functionallity
        - Meta-programming
          - This is what many of the features of Elixir that I just talked about is built on. It is a way to add syntactical sugar without changing the whole language.
    - conclusion
      - reenforcement
      - conclusion
        - There has been little actual gain with sharing code between front and back-end
        - Why I gave the talk
          - The goal
          - The why, because there is so much more out there.
            - Drupal 8 got us off the island by addopting composer
            - Drupal is fine, it exists well within the php landscape
              - We need to get off our php planet
              - If Drupal is going to continue to get good we need to know what else is going on
      - Live View
        - Last year, I wasn't planning on giving a talk at DrupalCon this year
        - I figured you all had heard enough from me two years in a row
        - Then I went to ElixirCon and I saw this
          - Demo some Phoenix LiveView
        - This has the potential to change everything about how a web app is expected to work
        - HTTP/2 and WS isn't the best sollution for everything
          - a friend of mine once said, sometimes a table should just be a table
          - a website can just be a website
          - But Drupal's market position isn't in just a website
          - Drupal is for interesting web-apps according to Dries
