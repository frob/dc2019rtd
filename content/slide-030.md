  notes:
    - The reason Drupal has been successful is because we always made big, forward-looking changes. It’s a cliché, but change has always been the only constant in Drupal. The result is that Drupal has stayed relevant, unlike nearly every other Open Source CMS over the years. The biggest risk for our project is that we don't embrace change. Dries, 2013
    - So let's capture that thought for future reference. Sweeping changes are required to make major advances in technology, and often times there is a lot of pain before the pay-off. Dries, 2006
    - Switching to semver should allow for smaller backward compatible changes.
    - Testing infrastructure should ensure backward compatible changes are backward compatible. The DA infrastructure team has made this a reality.
    - Good news, there are fewer changes for site builders to worry about.
    - Fields, Entities abstractions match moving from D7 to D8
    - Doesn't mean there is a clear upgrade path.
