## When are sprints?

April 24-27: Sprint Lounge at Baltimore Convention Center

April 28: **Sprint Day** - General Sprints, Mentored Core Sprint, **First-Time Sprinter** Workshop at Baltimore Convention Center

We also provide a 24-hour Sprinter Lounge that opens on April 24th at 7:00pm and will close on Thursday, April 27th at midnight. The Sprinter Lounge will be located at the **Hilton Baltimore (401 West Pratt Street) in room Peale A-C**.

Based on community feedback and input from the Sprint Leads, we understand the need for 'shorter sprints with greater support', and as a result will **not** be hosting Extended Weekend Sprints at this DrupalCon.
