>>> notes
- There has been little actual gain with sharing code between front and back-end
- Why I gave the talk
  - The goal
  - The why, because there is so much more out there.
    - Drupal 8 got us off the island by addopting composer
    - Drupal is fine, it exists well within the php landscape
      - We need to get off our php planet
      - If Drupal is going to continue to get good we need to know what else is going on
- Live View
  - Last year, I wasn't planning on giving a talk at DrupalCon this year
  - I figured you all had heard enough from me two years in a row
  - Then I went to ElixirCon and I saw this
    - Demo some Phoenix LiveView
  - This has the potential to change everything about how a web app is expected to work
    - This got me excited
    - This is events in the browser causing things to happen on the server without a full http request and without isomorphic front/backend javascript
    - This is like the first time getting Drupal's ajax form api to work as expected
    - This is running on my machine right now
    - **play snake**
  - HTTP/2 and WS isn't the best sollution for everything
    - a website can just be a website
    - But Drupal's market position isn't in just a website
    - Drupal is for interesting web-apps
