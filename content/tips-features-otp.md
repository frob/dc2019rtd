- Open Telecom Platform
- gives us supervision trees, event managers, and other goodness.
- Basically all of the Erlang Platform.
- Concurrency
  - BeamVM will automatically use as many resources as you give it
  - That isn't limited to a single machine
  - once a another server is brought on line in only needs to link to the other servers and the load will be evenly spread across it
